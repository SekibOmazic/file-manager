The provided `CustomArchiveService` is a fascinating and highly advanced piece of engineering. It represents a "pure" reactive approach to the problem.

Let's break down the comparison using your criteria.

### Key Architectural Difference

First, it's crucial to understand the fundamental difference between the two solutions:

*   **`StreamingZipService` (My Solution):** This is a **hybrid reactive model**. It wraps a traditional, blocking Java I/O library (`ZipOutputStream`) and safely integrates it into a reactive stream by offloading the blocking work to a dedicated thread pool (`Schedulers.boundedElastic`). It acts as a bridge between the blocking and non-blocking worlds.
*   **`CustomArchiveService` (Your Code):** This is a **pure reactive model**. It does not use any blocking libraries. Instead, it **reimplements the ZIP file format specification from scratch** using only reactive operators. It builds every part of the archive—local headers, compressed data, data descriptors, and the central directory—as individual reactive streams (`Flux<ByteBuffer>`) and concatenates them.

This core difference drives all the trade-offs.

### Analysis by Criteria

#### 1. Reactive, Non-blocking, Memory and CPU

**Winner: `CustomArchiveService`**

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Non-Blocking:** The `CustomArchiveService` is the theoretical ideal. The entire process, including the DEFLATE compression, happens within the reactive chain. It never needs to leave the event-loop threads (like Netty's) to perform its work. This avoids the overhead of thread context switching.
    *   **CPU:** My `StreamingZipService` forces a context switch for every piece of data written to the zip. The data is handed off from a WebFlux thread to a `boundedElastic` worker thread via the `PipedInputStream`. This context switching consumes CPU cycles. `CustomArchiveService` avoids this entirely, making it more CPU-efficient, especially under very high load.
    *   **Memory:** Both solutions are excellent and have a constant memory footprint. They both process data in chunks without buffering entire files. The difference in memory usage would be negligible.

#### 2. Speed

**Winner: Tie, with a slight theoretical edge to `CustomArchiveService`**

*   **Analysis:**
    *   On paper, `CustomArchiveService` should be faster because it avoids the thread context switching and potential I/O bottlenecks of the `PipedInputStream` bridge used in my solution.
    *   However, `java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream` and its underlying `Deflater` are part of the JDK, written in a mix of Java and highly optimized native C code. It is extremely fast. The manual implementation of the compression loop in `CustomArchiveService`, while non-blocking, might not be as raw-performant as the JDK's native implementation.
    *   Furthermore, the `copyByteBuffer` calls in the custom service create a small amount of overhead by allocating and copying memory for every single chunk.
    *   In a real-world scenario, the bottleneck will almost certainly be the network I/O from downloading from S3, not the zipping logic. **The speed difference between the two is likely to be academically interesting but practically unnoticeable for the end-user.**

#### 3. Robustness

**Winner: `StreamingZipService` (by a very large margin)**

*   **Analysis:** This is the most critical difference for a production environment.
    *   **Standard Library vs. Re-implementation:** My solution leverages `ZipOutputStream`, a class that has been part of the standard Java Development Kit for decades. It is battle-hardened, thoroughly tested, and handles all the complexities and edge cases of the ZIP specification internally. You can trust it to produce a valid archive.
    *   **Specification Complexity:** `CustomArchiveService` reimplements the ZIP specification. This is an **extremely high-risk** endeavor. The ZIP format has many subtle details (DOS timestamps, version flags, extra fields, and critically, the **ZIP64 format for files or archives > 4GB**). The provided custom code does not appear to handle ZIP64, meaning it will create corrupt archives for large files. Fixing this would add even more complexity.
    *   **Error Handling:** In my solution, if any file fails, the `try-catch` block handles it cleanly. If the `ZipOutputStream` itself fails, it throws an `IOException`, which breaks the pipe and cleanly propagates an `onError` signal to the reactive stream. In `CustomArchiveService`, the state management (especially the side-effect of populating `zipEntries`) across multiple concatenated reactive streams is more fragile. An error in one of the file streams could leave the overall process in an inconsistent state if not handled with extreme care.

#### 4. Code Quality (Structure, Readability, Maintainability)

**Winner: `StreamingZipService`**

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Readability:** The intent of `StreamingZipService` is immediately clear to any Java developer: "Run this blocking code on another thread." The business logic (`for` loop, `zos.putNextEntry`) is simple, sequential, and easy to follow.
    *   **Maintainability:** Maintaining `StreamingZipService` is trivial. The complexity is handled by the JDK. In contrast, maintaining `CustomArchiveService` is a significant burden. A developer would need to be an expert in both Project Reactor *and* the ZIP file format specification to safely modify or debug it. Finding a subtle bug in the manual byte buffer manipulation could take days.
    *   **Structure:** My solution has a clean separation of concerns: the `zipFiles` method contains the simple business logic, and the `createZipStream` method contains the reactive "plumbing" to make it non-blocking. The custom solution mixes very low-level byte manipulation directly within complex reactive chains (`concatMap`, `doOnComplete`, etc.), making it much harder to reason about.

### Final Recommendation

While the `CustomArchiveService` is an impressive and technically elegant *purely reactive* solution, **I would strongly recommend using the `StreamingZipService` (my hybrid solution) for any production system.**

**Choose `StreamingZipService` (Hybrid Model) because:**
*   It is **vastly more robust and reliable** by leveraging the standard, battle-tested JDK library.
*   It is **infinitely easier to read, debug, and maintain.**
*   Its performance is more than sufficient for almost any use case, and the performance difference is likely negligible in the real world.

**Consider `CustomArchiveService` (Pure Model) only if:**
*   You are in an extreme-performance environment where even the slightest overhead of thread context switching is unacceptable.
*   You have a team of developers with expert-level knowledge of both reactive programming and the ZIP specification.
*   You have the resources to thoroughly test for specification compliance, including all edge cases like ZIP64.

For production-grade software, pragmatism and robustness trump theoretical purity. The hybrid model provides the perfect balance of reactive performance and reliable, maintainable code.
