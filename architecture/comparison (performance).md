This is the ultimate question for comparing these two architectural patterns. It gets to the very heart of the "why" behind reactive programming.

**The short answer:** The `CustomArchiveService` (Pure Reactive model) will handle significantly more concurrent requests in an identical environment.

The difference in performance won't be noticeable at low loads, but it will become dramatic as the number of simultaneous requests increases.

### The Key Differentiator: The Threading Model

The reason for the performance difference comes down to how each solution uses threads.

*   **`StreamingArchiveService` (Hybrid):** This solution uses the `Schedulers.boundedElastic` pool. Think of this as a pool of specialized "blocking workers." For **every concurrent zip request** that comes in, one worker thread is checked out from this pool and is dedicated to that single request until it's complete.

*   **`CustomArchiveService` (Pure Reactive):** This solution does **not** use a blocking pool. It runs entirely on the main, non-blocking event-loop threads (e.g., Netty threads managed by WebFlux). Think of these threads as highly efficient multitaskers. A single thread can juggle the data processing for hundreds of different requests simultaneously, processing a small chunk for request A, then a chunk for request B, then a chunk for A again, and so on. It never dedicates a full thread to a single request.

### Scenario-Based Performance Analysis

Let's assume your server has 4 CPU cores.

*   The **Pure Reactive** model will use a small, fixed number of event-loop threads (e.g., 4).
*   The **Hybrid** model's `boundedElastic` pool will have a default cap of `10 * 4 = 40` threads.

#### Scenario 1: Low Load (1-10 concurrent requests)

*   **Hybrid:** 10 requests arrive. 10 threads are checked out from the `boundedElastic` pool. There are still 30 available threads in the pool. Both solutions perform excellently. The end-user would not notice any difference.
*   **Pure Reactive:** 10 requests arrive. The 4 event-loop threads begin juggling the data streams for all 10 requests. CPU usage is low. Performance is excellent.
*   **Winner:** Tie.

#### Scenario 2: High Load (50 concurrent requests)

*   **Hybrid:** 50 requests arrive.
    *   The first 40 requests each take one thread from the `boundedElastic` pool. The pool is now **saturated**.
    *   The next 10 requests (`#41` to `#50`) are **queued**. They have to wait until one of the first 40 requests finishes and returns its thread to the pool.
    *   **Result:** Latency for these later requests skyrockets. Your server's throughput has hit a hard ceiling defined by the thread pool size. The service feels sluggish for new users.
*   **Pure Reactive:** 50 requests arrive.
    *   The 4 event-loop threads simply add the 50 new data streams to the set of tasks they are juggling.
    *   The CPU usage will climb significantly, likely approaching 100%.
    *   **Result:** The service remains responsive to all 50 requests. It continues to make progress on all of them. The time to complete any *single* request might be slightly longer than at low load because it's sharing CPU time, but the overall throughput of the system remains very high. No requests are artificially queued.
*   **Winner:** `CustomArchiveService` (Pure Reactive) by a large margin.

#### Scenario 3: Saturation Point (The Bottleneck)

*   **Hybrid:** The bottleneck is the **size of the `boundedElastic` thread pool**. Performance degrades gracefully up to that limit, and then falls off a cliff as new requests are forced to wait.
*   **Pure Reactive:** The bottleneck is **100% CPU utilization**. The system scales almost linearly with the number of requests until the CPU simply cannot perform the work (compression, etc.) any faster.

### Summary Comparison Table

| Metric | `StreamingArchiveService` (Hybrid) | `CustomArchiveService` (Pure Reactive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Throughput (Requests/sec)** | Good, but with a hard cap. | **Excellent**, limited only by CPU. |
| **Scalability** | Limited by thread pool size. | **Excellent**, scales with CPU power. |
| **Resource Usage** | High thread count under load. Each thread consumes ~1MB of stack memory. | Very low thread count. More CPU-intensive. |
| **Predictability** | Performance is very predictable up to the thread limit. | Performance can degrade for *all* users as CPU saturates. |

### Final Recommendation (Revisited)

This analysis confirms that the **Pure Reactive model has superior theoretical performance and scalability.**

However, my previous recommendation **still stands for most business applications.** The Hybrid model's scalability is often "good enough." A server that can handle 40 simultaneous, long-running zip creations is already quite powerful.

You choose the **Pure Reactive (`CustomArchiveService`)** model when:
*   You are building a high-throughput, core infrastructure service where every ounce of performance matters.
*   You expect a very high number of concurrent requests (hundreds or thousands).
*   You have the expert development and testing resources to manage its complexity and ensure its correctness (especially for things like the ZIP64 format).

You choose the **Hybrid (`StreamingArchiveService`)** model when:
*   You need a robust, reliable, and maintainable solution.
*   Your expected concurrent load is within reasonable bounds (tens, not thousands).
*   You want to deliver a high-quality feature quickly without the risk of re-implementing a complex file format.
